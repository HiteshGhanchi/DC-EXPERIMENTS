### Step 2: Run Static Test (Part 1 - Round Robin)

In a new terminal, run the load test:

```bash
python3 load_test.py

**Observation (Round Robin):** The output will show an almost **perfectly even distribution** (e.g., $334/333/333$), confirming the **static** nature of the Round Robin algorithm. 

### Step 3: Simulate Dynamic Change (Part 2 - Adaptation)

1.  **Simulate Failure:** Stop one application container (e.g., `app2`) to simulate failure or high load.
    ```bash
    docker stop app2
    2.  **Re-run the Test:** Run the load test again:
    ```bash
    python3 load_test.py
    
**Observation (Dynamic Adaptation):** You will observe two key changes:

* **Initial Failures:** You might see some initial errors for `app2` requests while Nginx figures out it's down.
* **Redistribution:** Nginx will automatically remove `app2` from the rotation, and the load will be split between `app1` and `app3` (e.g., $500/500$), demonstrating a basic form of **dynamic fault tolerance**.

This completes the required implementation and testing for LAB 10.
